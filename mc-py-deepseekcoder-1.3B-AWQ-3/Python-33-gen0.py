def calculate_score(system: int, points: str) -> list:
    """
    Calculate the score of a series of ping-pong games based on the provided scoring system.

    This function takes in the desired scoring system (either 11 or 21 points) and a string 
    representing the sequence of points won by the player ('W') and the opponent ('L'). 
    The function processes the string and returns a list of game scores formatted as "player_score:opponent_score".

    The game is considered finished when one player reaches the system's required number of points 
    (11 or 21) with at least a 2-point lead. If the sequence of points ends in the middle of a game, 
    that game's current score is also included in the output.

    Args:
    - system (int): The number of points required to win a game (either 11 or 21).
    - points (str): A string of 'W' and 'L' characters denoting points won by the player and opponent.

    Returns:
    - list: A list of strings representing the score of each game.

    Cases:
    >>> calculate_score(11, "WWWWWWWWWWL")
    ["10:1"]
