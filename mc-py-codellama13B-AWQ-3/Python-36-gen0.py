def remaining_trees_after_clearing(l: int, areas: List[Tuple[int, int]]) -> int:
    """
    Calculate the number of remaining trees along a road after specific areas have been cleared.

    The road is represented as a straight line of length 'l' and is initially filled with trees.
    Each area scheduled for clearing is specified as a pair of integers (start, end), representing
    the inclusive range along the road where the trees will be removed.

    Args:
    - l (int): The length of the road.
    - areas (List[Tuple[int, int]]): A list of tuples where each tuple represents a cleared area on the road.
    
    Returns:
    - int: The total number of trees remaining along the road after the specified areas have been cleared.
    
    Examples:
    - remaining_trees_after_clearing(10, [(2, 5), (7, 9)]) will return 5    
    - remaining_trees_after_clearing(100, [(10, 90)]) will return 20.
