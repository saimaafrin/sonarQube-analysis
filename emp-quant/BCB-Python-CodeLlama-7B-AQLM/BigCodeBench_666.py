def task_func(seq, letter_weight_dict):
    """
    Find the subsequence in a string that has the maximum total weight based on the weights given for each character. 
    The weights are assigned randomly and a subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from another sequence by deleting some elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.

    Parameters:
    - seq (str): The input string.
    - letter_weight_dict (dict): A dictionary with the weights for each character.

    Returns:
    - str: The subsequence with the highest weight.

    Requirements:
    - itertools
    - math

    Example:
    >>> task_func('abc', {'a': 1, 'b': 2, 'c': 3})
    'abc'
    >>> task_func('aabc', {'a': 10, 'b': -5, 'c': 3})
    'aac'
