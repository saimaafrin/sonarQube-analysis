def task_func(elements, subset_size):
    """
    Generate all subsets of a given size from a tuple and calculate the mean, median, and mode of the sums of the subsets.

    Args:
    - elements (tuple): A tuple of numbers from which subsets will be generated.
    - subset_size (int): The size of the subsets to be generated.

    Returns:
    dict: A dictionary with the mean, median, and mode of the sums of the subsets.

    Requirements:
    - itertools
    - statistics
    
    Example:
    >>> task_func((1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10), 2)
    {'mean': 11, 'median': 11, 'mode': 11}
