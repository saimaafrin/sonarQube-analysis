def task_func(directory):
    """
    Generates RSA public and private keys, encrypts all files in the specified directory using the public key,
    and saves the encrypted files into a zip file. It returns the public key and the name of the zip file.

    Note: This method directly encrypts file data with RSA, which is not recommended for large files or
    production use. Typically, RSA is used to encrypt a symmetric key (like AES), which is then used to
    encrypt the actual data.

    Parameters:
    directory (str): The directory containing the files to be encrypted.

    Returns:
    rsa.PublicKey: The RSA public key.
    str: The filename of the zip file containing the encrypted files.

    Requirements:
    - rsa
    - os
    - zipfile
    - base64.b64encode

    Examples:
    >>> pub_key, zipfile_name = task_func('./')
    >>> isinstance(pub_key, rsa.PublicKey)
    'True'
    >>> isinstance(zipfile_name, str)
    'True'
