    Moves all files that match a particular pattern from one directory to another.
    
    Functionality:
    - Moves files from 'source_directory' to 'destination_directory' based on a filename pattern 'file_pattern'.
    
    Parameters:
    - source_directory (str): The path to the source directory from which files will be moved.
    - destination_directory (str): The path to the destination directory to which files will be moved.
    - file_pattern (str): The file pattern to match (e.g., '*.txt' for all text files).
    
    Returns:
    - Returns a list of filenames that were moved.
    
    Requirements:
    - os
    - shutil
    - fnmatch
    
    Example:
    >>> task_func('/path/to/source', '/path/to/destination', '*.txt')
    ['task_func_data/file1.txt', 'task_func_data/file2.txt']
