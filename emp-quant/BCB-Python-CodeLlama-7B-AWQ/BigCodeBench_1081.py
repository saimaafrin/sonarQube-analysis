    Converts string-formatted weights to floats and plots a scatter plot of weight against height.
    This function takes a dictionary with two keys: 'Weight_String' and 'Height'.
    The 'Weight_String' key should contain a list of weight values in string format, while the 'Height' key should have a list of corresponding height values in numerical format.
    If the input dictionary is not provided, the function uses a default dataset.
    The function then converts the string-formatted weights into float, and plots a scatter plot to visualize the relationship between weight and height.
    The function should raise the exception for: ValueError: If any of the values in the 'Weight_String' key are not formatted as strings.
    This validation ensures that the weight data is in the expected format for conversion to float.
    The function should output with:
        ax (matplotlib.axes._axes.Axes): A scatter plot with weight on the x-axis and height on the y-axis, titled "Weight vs Height".
