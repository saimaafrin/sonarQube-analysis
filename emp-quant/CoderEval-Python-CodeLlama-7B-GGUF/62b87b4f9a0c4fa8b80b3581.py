	Compute or set scale (integral of the histogram).

If *other* is ``None``, return scale of this histogram.
If its scale was not computed before,
it is computed and stored for subsequent use
(unless explicitly asked to *recompute*).
Note that after changing (filling) the histogram
one must explicitly recompute the scale
if it was computed before.

If a float *other* is provided, rescale self to *other*.

Histograms with scale equal to zero can't be rescaled.
:exc:`.LenaValueError` is raised if one tries to do that.
