def max_herb_value(T: int, M: int, herbs: List[Tuple[int, int]]) -> int:
    """
    Calculate the maximum total value of herbs that can be picked within a given time limit.

    This function solves a variation of the 0/1 knapsack problem where the goal is to maximize
    the total value of herbs picked without exceeding the time limit. Each herb can be picked
    at most once and has an associated time cost and value.

    Args:
    - T (int): The total time available for picking herbs.
    - M (int): The number of different herbs in the cave.
    - herbs (List[Tuple[int, int]]): A list of tuples, where each tuple contains two integers
      representing the time required to pick the herb and the herb's value, respectively.

    Returns:
    - int: The maximum total value of herbs that can be picked within the time limit.

    Examples:
    - max_herb_value(70, 3, [(71, 100), (69, 1), (1, 2)]) -> 3
    - max_herb_value(5, 3, [(5, 10), (4, 7), (6, 12)]) -> 10
