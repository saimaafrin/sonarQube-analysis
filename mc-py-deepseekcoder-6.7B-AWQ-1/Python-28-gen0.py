def string_transformation(A: str, B: str, rules: list) -> Union[int, str]:
    """
    Perform string transformation from A to B using a set of transformation rules.

    This function takes an initial string A and a target string B, along with a list
    of transformation rules, and attempts to transform A into B using the rules.
    A Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm is used to explore the possible transformations
    up to a maximum of 10 steps. If A can be transformed into B within 10 steps, the function
    returns the minimum number of steps required. If it's not possible, the function returns
    "NO ANSWER!".

    Parameters:
    A (str): The initial string to be transformed.
    B (str): The target string to be achieved.
    rules (list of tuples): A list of transformation rules, where each rule is a tuple
                            containing the source substring (to be replaced) and the
                            target substring (to replace with).

    Returns:
    Union[int, str]: The minimum number of transformation steps if possible, otherwise "NO ANSWER!".

    Examples:
    >>> string_transformation("abcd", "xyz", [("abc", "xu"), ("ud", "y"), ("y", "yz")])
    3
    >>> string_transformation("aaa", "bbbb", [("a", "b"), ("aa", "bb"), ("aaa", "bbb")])
    'NO ANSWER!'
