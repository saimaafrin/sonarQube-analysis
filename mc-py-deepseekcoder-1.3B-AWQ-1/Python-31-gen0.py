def generate_numbers(n, rules) -> int:
    """
    Generate all unique numbers from the given number by applying transformation rules.

    Each rule allows a single digit to be transformed into another. A breadth-first search
    (BFS) is used to explore all possible transformations. The function returns the count
    of unique numbers that can be generated from the original number, including the number itself.

    Args:
    - n (int): The original integer number to transform.
    - rules (list of tuples): A list of transformation rules, where each rule is represented
                              as a tuple (x, y) indicating that digit x can be transformed into y.

    Returns:
    - int: The total count of unique numbers that can be generated.

    Cases:
    >>> generate_numbers(234, [(2, 5), (3, 6)])
    4
    >>> generate_numbers(100, [(1, 9)])
    2
