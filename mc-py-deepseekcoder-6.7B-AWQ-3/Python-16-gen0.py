def count_passing_ways(n: int, m: int) -> int:
    """
    Counts the number of different ways to pass a ball among 'n' students arranged in a circle 
    such that after 'm' passes, the ball returns to the starting student.

    The function uses dynamic programming to determine the number of passing sequences. Each student
    can pass the ball either to the left neighbor or to the right neighbor.

    Args:
    n: The number of students standing in a circle.
    m: The number of times the ball is passed.

    Returns:
    An integer representing the number of distinct passing ways that result in the ball
    returning to the starting student after 'm' passes.

    Cases:
    >>> count_passing_ways(3, 3)
    2
    >>> count_passing_ways(5, 4)
    6
