    We are given two strings s and c, you have to deleted all the characters in s that are equal to any character in c
    then check if the result string is palindrome.
    A string is called palindrome if it reads the same backward as forward.
    You should return a tuple containing the result string and True/False for the check.
    Example
    >>> reverse_delete('abcde', 'ae')
    ('bcd', False)
    >>> reverse_delete('abcdef', 'b')
    ('acdef', False)
    >>> reverse_delete('abcdedcba', 'ab')
