    Given an array arr of integers, find the minimum number of elements that

    is read the same backwards and forwards. In one change, you can change one element to any other element.

    For example:
    >>> smallest_change([1, 2, 3, 5, 4, 7, 9, 6])
    4
    >>> smallest_change([1, 2, 3, 4, 3, 2, 2])
