def car_race_collision(n: int) -> int:
    """
    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
    n cars are driving left to right;  simultaneously, a different set of n cars
    are driving right to left.   The two sets of cars start out being very far from
    each other.  All cars move in the same speed.  Two cars are said to collide
    when a car that's moving left to right hits a car that's moving right to left.
    However, the cars are infinitely sturdy and strong; as a result, they continue moving
    in their trajectory as if they did not collide.

    This function outputs the number of such collisions.

    # This is a solution for the problem:

    #
    # First, the function converts the problem into the problem with the number of
    # collisions. Then, the function solves the problem.
    #
    # The function converts the problem into the problem with the number of collisions
    # as follows.
    #
    # The problem states that the distance between the first car and the last car
    # is n.   The problem also states that the distance between the first car
    # and the last car is twice the distance between the second car and the
    # second-to-last car.   The problem also states that the distance between
    # the first car and the last car is four times the distance between the
    # third car and the third-to-last car.   The problem also states that the
    # distance between the first car and the last car is eight times the distance
    # between the fourth car and the fourth-to-last car.
    #
    # By the same reasoning, the distance between the first car and the last
    # car is 16 times the distance between the fifth car and the fifth-to-last
    # car.   The distance between the first car and the last car is 32 times
    # the distance between the sixth car and the sixth-to-last car.  The
    # distance between the first car and the last car is 64 times the distance
    # between the seventh car and the seventh-to-last car.
    #
    # In general, the distance between the first car and the last car is 2^x
    # times the distance between the x+1 car and the x+1-th-to-last car.
    #
    # We can use the formula above to get the distance between the first car
    # and the last car.   We can then use the formula for the distance between
    # two points to get the number of collisions.

    # We use a formula below.   We need to convert n to a binary number.
    #
    # For example, if n is 5, then the binary representation of 5 is 101.
    #
    # We need to convert 101 to a binary number.   We can use a formula below
    # to do that.

    # We need to get the binary representation of the number.   We can use
    # a formula below.
