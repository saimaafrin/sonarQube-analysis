def count_partitions(n: int, k: int, x: int) -> int:
    """
    Count the number of ways to partition an integer n into k parts,
    where each part is at least x and order of parts does not matter.

    Parameters:
    n (int): The integer to be partitioned.
    k (int): The number of parts to divide n into.
    x (int): The minimum value for each part.

    Returns:
    int: The number of distinct partitioning ways.

    Examples:
    >>> count_partitions(7, 3, 1)
    4
    >>> count_partitions(6, 2, 1)
    3
