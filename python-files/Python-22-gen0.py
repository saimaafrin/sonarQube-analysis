def decode(encoded: str, original: str, message: str) -> str:
    """
    Decodes an encrypted message using a cipher derived from a known encoded-original pair.
    
    The function builds a mapping from encoded letters to their original letters and uses this
    mapping to decode a given encrypted message. If a contradiction is found during mapping
    construction, or not all letters are represented in the mapping, the function returns "Failed".
    
    Args:
    encoded (str): A string representing the encoded information.
    original (str): A string representing the original information corresponding to the encoded string.
    message (str): A string representing the encrypted message to be decoded.
    
    Returns:
    str: The decoded message if successful, or "Failed" if the decoding is not possible.
    
    Examples:
    >>> decode("AA", "AB", "EOWIE")
    'Failed'    
    >>> decode("MSRTZCJKPFLQYVAWBINXUEDGHOOILSMIJFRCOPPQCEUNYDUMPP", "YIZSDWAHLNOVFUCERKJXQMGTBPPKOIYKANZWPLLVWMQJFGQYLL", "FLSO")
