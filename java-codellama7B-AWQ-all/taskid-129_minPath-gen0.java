class Problem {
    // Given a grid with N rows and N columns (N >= 2) and a positive integer k, 
    // each cell of the grid contains a value. Every integer in the range [1, N * N]
    // inclusive appears exactly once on the cells of the grid.
    // You have to find the minimum path of length k in the grid. You can start
    // from any cell, and in each step you can move to any of the neighbor cells,
    // in other words, you can go to cells which share an edge with you current
    // cell.
    // Please note that a path of length k means visiting exactly k cells (not
    // necessarily distinct).
    // You CANNOT go off the grid.
    // A path A (of length k) is considered less than a path B (of length k) if
    // after making the ordered array lists of the values on the cells that A and B go
    // through (let's call them lst_A and lst_B), lst_A is lexicographically less
    // than lst_B, in other words, there exist an integer index i (1 <= i <= k)
    // such that lst_A[i] < lst_B[i] and for any j (1 <= j < i) we have
    // lst_A[j] = lst_B[j].
    // It is guaranteed that the answer is unique.
    // Return an ordered array list of the values on the cells that the minimum path go through.
    // Examples:    
    // >>> minPath((new ArrayList<ArrayList<Long>>(Arrays.asList((ArrayList<Long>)new ArrayList<Long>(Arrays.asList((long)1l, (long)2l, (long)3l)), (ArrayList<Long>)new ArrayList<Long>(Arrays.asList((long)4l, (long)5l, (long)6l)), (ArrayList<Long>)new ArrayList<Long>(Arrays.asList((long)7l, (long)8l, (long)9l))))), (3l))
