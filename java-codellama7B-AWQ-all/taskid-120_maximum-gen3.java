class Problem {

    // of length k with the maximum k numbers in arr.

    // >>> maximum((new ArrayList<Long>(Arrays.asList((long)-3l, (long)-4l, (long)5l))), (3l))
    // (new ArrayList<Long>(Arrays.asList((long)-4l, (long)-3l, (long)5l)))

    // 1. The length of the array array list will be in the range of [1, 1000].
