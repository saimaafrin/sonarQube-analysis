    // I think we all remember that feeling when the result of some long-awaited
    // event is finally known. The feelings and thoughts you have at that moment are
    // definitely worth noting down and comparing.
    // Your task is to determine if a person correctly guessed the results of a number of matches.
    // You are given two array array lists of scores and guesses of equal length, where each index shows a match. 
    // Return an array array list of the same length denoting how far off each guess was. If they have guessed correctly,
    // the value is 0, and if not, the value is the absolute difference between the guess and the score.
    // example:
    // >>> compare((new ArrayList<Long>(Arrays.asList((long)1l, (long)2l, (long)3l, (long)4l, (long)5l, (long)1l))), (new ArrayList<Long>(Arrays.asList((long)1l, (long)2l, (long)3l, (long)4l, (long)2l, (long)-2l))))
