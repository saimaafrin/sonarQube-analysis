class Problem {
    // You are given a rectangular grid of wells. Each row represents a single well,
    // and each 1 in a row represents a single unit of water.
    // Each well has a corresponding bucket that can be used to extract water from it, 
    // and all buckets have the same capacity.
    // Your task is to use the buckets to empty the wells.
    // Output the number of times you need to lower the buckets.
    // Example 1:
    // >>> maxFill((new ArrayList<ArrayList<Long>>(Arrays.asList((ArrayList<Long>)new ArrayList<Long>(Arrays.asList((long)0l, (long)0l, (long)1l, (long)0l)), (ArrayList<Long>)new ArrayList<Long>(Arrays.asList((long)0l, (long)1l, (long)0l, (long)0l)), (ArrayList<Long>)new ArrayList<Long>(Arrays.asList((long)1l, (long)1l, (long)1l, (long)1l))))), (1l))

    // >>> maxFill((new ArrayList<ArrayList<Long>>(Arrays.asList((ArrayList<Long>)new ArrayList<Long>(Arrays.asList((long)0l, (long)0l, (long)1l, (long)1l)), (ArrayList<Long>)new ArrayList<Long>(Arrays.asList((long)0l, (long)0l, (long)0l, (long)0l)), (ArrayList<Long>)new ArrayList<Long>(Arrays.asList((long)1l, (long)1l, (long)1l, (long)1l)), (ArrayList<Long>)new ArrayList<Long>(Arrays.asList((long)0l, (long)1l, (long)1l, (long)1l))))), (2l))
