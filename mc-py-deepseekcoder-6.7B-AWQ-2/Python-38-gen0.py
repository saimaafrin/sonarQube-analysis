def min_remaining_space(V: int, n: int, volumes: List[int]) -> int:
    """
    Calculate the minimum remaining space in a box after trying to fit a number of items with given volumes.
    
    This function uses a dynamic programming approach to determine the maximum volume that can be occupied
    in the box by any subset of the given items. It then returns the difference between the box's total capacity
    and this maximum occupied volume, which is the minimum remaining space.

    Args:
    - V (int): The total capacity of the box.
    - n (int): The number of items to consider for packing into the box.
    - volumes (List[int]): A list of the volumes of the n items.

    Returns:
    - int: The minimum remaining space in the box after fitting the items.

    Examples:
    - min_remaining_space(24, 6, [8, 3, 12, 7, 9, 7]) -> 0
    - min_remaining_space(5, 3, [6, 7, 8]) -> 5
