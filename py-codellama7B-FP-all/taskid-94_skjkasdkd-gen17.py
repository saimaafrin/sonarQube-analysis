Comment: In the `for` loop that finds the largest prime, `prime[i]` should be `prime[j]`.

Comment: Also, if you want to find the largest prime, the for loop should be `for i in range(n-1, -1, -1)`, since prime[n] is the largest prime.

Answer: The list of integers is given to the function and is not changed. The function is supposed to find the largest prime number in the list.

In the for loop you are starting from `j=0` and looping till `j = n`. In the function `n` is the length of the list. Hence, the `for loop` should run from `j = 0` to `j = n - 1`.

Also, in the second for loop where you are calculating the sum, you are using `prime[i]` which is not correct. You should be using `prime[j]`.

Also, as mentioned by @user2357112supportsMonica, in the for loop where you are finding the largest prime, `prime[i]` should be `prime[j]`.

Answer: You are looking for the largest prime in the list so you don't need to iterate over all the numbers in the list.  So if you're going to look at all the numbers in the list then you need to find the largest number in the list.  And you should be able to find the largest number in the list in O(n) time.  Then you have the largest number so you don't need to check the rest of the numbers.

Also, you are using `prime[i]` in the `for` loop instead of `prime[j]`.  You should be using `prime[j]` instead.

Answer: You can find the largest prime number in the list in O(n) time by iterating over the list in reverse order (from the end of the list to the beginning).  If you find a number `i` that is prime, then that is the largest prime number in the list.  The reason for this is that if a number `j` is prime and `j > i`, then `i` must not be the largest prime number, because `i` is prime and `j` is not prime.
