    Write a function that takes a message, and encodes in such a 
    way that it swaps case of all letters, replaces all vowels in 
    the message with the letter that appears 2 places ahead of that 
    vowel in the english alphabet. 
    Assume only letters.

    >>> encode('test')
    'TGST'
    >>> encode('This is a message')

    # Use the chr() function to convert the number to the letter
    # Use a for loop to go through all the letters and make the 
    # modifications.
    # Return the encoded message
