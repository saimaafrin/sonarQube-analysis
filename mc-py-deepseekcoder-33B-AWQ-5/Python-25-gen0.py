def count_sequences(n: int, last: int, memo: dict) -> int:
    """
    Calculate the number of valid sequences that can be formed according to specific rules.
    
    Each sequence starts with a given number 'n', and a new number can be appended to the sequence
    if it is a positive integer and not greater than half the last number in the sequence. This
    function uses memoization to store previously calculated results to optimize performance.
    
    Args:
        n (int): The starting number of the sequence.
        last (int): The last number in the current sequence.
        memo (dict): A dictionary used for memoization, storing the number of valid sequences
                     for each 'last' value encountered.
    
    Returns:
        int: The total number of valid sequences that can be formed starting with 'n'.
    
    Examples:
        >>> count_sequences(1, 1, {})
        1
        >>> count_sequences(6, 6, {})
        6
