def calculate_arrangements(n, m, a) -> int:
    """
    Compute the number of ways to arrange m pots of flowers using up to n types,
    where the ith type can have at most a[i] pots, and the arrangement must be in
    increasing order of flower types.

    Args:
    - n (int): The number of flower types available.
    - m (int): The total number of flower pots to arrange.
    - a (list of int): A list where a[i] is the maximum number of pots for the ith type of flower.

    Returns:
    - int: The number of distinct arrangements modulo (10^6 + 7).

    Examples:
    - calculate_arrangements(2, 4, [3, 2]) returns 2.
    - calculate_arrangements(3, 3, [1, 2, 3]) returns 6.
