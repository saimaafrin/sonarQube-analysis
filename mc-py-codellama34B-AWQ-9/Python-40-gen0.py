def vigenere_decrypt(key: str, ciphertext: str) -> str:
    """
    Decrypts a ciphertext encrypted with the Vigenère cipher using the provided key.
    
    The Vigenère cipher is a method of encrypting alphabetic text by using a series of
    Caesar ciphers based on the letters of a keyword. This function reverses the process
    to recover the original plaintext from the ciphertext.

    Args:
        key (str): The encryption key used to encrypt the original plaintext.
                   This key should consist only of alphabetic characters.
        ciphertext (str): The encrypted text that needs to be decrypted.
                          The ciphertext should consist only of alphabetic characters.

    Returns:
        str: The decrypted plaintext corresponding to the input ciphertext.

    Examples:
        >>> vigenere_decrypt("CompleteVictory", "Yvqgpxaimmklongnzfwpvxmniytm")
        'Wherethereisawillthereisaway'

        >>> vigenere_decrypt("ABC", "DEF")
