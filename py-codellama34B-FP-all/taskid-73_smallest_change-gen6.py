    """
    Given an array arr of integers, find the minimum number of elements that
    need to be changed to make the array palindromic. A palindromic array is an array that
    is read the same backwards and forwards. In one change, you can change one element to any other element.

    For example:
    >>> smallest_change([1, 2, 3, 5, 4, 7, 9, 6])
    4
    >>> smallest_change([1, 2, 3, 4, 3, 2, 2])
    1
    >>> smallest_change([1, 2, 3, 2, 1])
    0

    # We can solve this problem by converting it to the Longest Palindromic Subsequence
    # problem. We can do this by adding a dummy element at the beginning and end of the array
    # and reversing the array. This will ensure that the middle element of the array is always
    # the same regardless of whether the array is palindromic or not.
    # We now have to find the longest palindromic subsequence of this new array. This can be
    # solved using a dynamic programming approach.
