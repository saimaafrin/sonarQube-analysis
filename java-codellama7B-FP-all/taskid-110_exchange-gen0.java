class Problem {
    // In this problem, you will implement a function that takes two array lists of numbers,
    // and determines whether it is possible to perform an exchange of elements
    // between them to make lst1 an array array list of only even numbers.
    // There is no limit on the number of exchanged elements between lst1 and lst2.
    // If it is possible to exchange elements between the lst1 and lst2 to make
    // all the elements of lst1 to be even, return "YES".
    // Otherwise, return "NO".
    // For example:
    // >>> exchange((new ArrayList<Long>(Arrays.asList((long)1l, (long)2l, (long)3l, (long)4l))), (new ArrayList<Long>(Arrays.asList((long)1l, (long)2l, (long)3l, (long)4l))))
    // ("YES")
    // >>> exchange((new ArrayList<Long>(Arrays.asList((long)1l, (long)2l, (long)3l, (long)4l))), (new ArrayList<Long>(Arrays.asList((long)1l, (long)5l, (long)3l, (long)4l))))
    // ("NO")
    // It is assumed that the input array lists will be non-empty.
