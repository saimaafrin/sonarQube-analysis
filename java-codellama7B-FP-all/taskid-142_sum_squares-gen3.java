    // This function will take an array array list of integers. For all entries in the array list, the function shall square the integer entry if its index is a 
    // multiple of 3 and will cube the integer entry if its index is a multiple of 4 and not a multiple of 3. The function will not 
    // change the entries in the array list whose indexes are not a multiple of 3 or 4. The function shall then return the sum of all entries. 
    // Examples:
    // >>> lst
    // (long)new ArrayList<Long>(Arrays.asList((long)1l, (long)2l, (long)3l))
    // >>> lst
    // (long)new ArrayList<Long>(Arrays.asList())
