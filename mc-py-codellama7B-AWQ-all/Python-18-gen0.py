    """
    Calculates the maximum total importance value of items that can be bought within a given budget.
    
    This function solves a variant of the 0-1 knapsack problem where each item has a price and an 
    associated importance value. The goal is to maximize the sum of the importance values of a 
    selection of items without the total price exceeding the budget.
    
    Args:
    n (int): The total budget available for purchasing items.
    m (int): The number of different items to choose from.
    items (List[Tuple[int, int]]): A list of tuples, where each tuple contains two integers:
        - The first integer represents the price of the item.
        - The second integer represents the importance value of the item.
    
    Returns:
    int: The maximum total importance value that can be achieved without exceeding the budget.
    
    Examples:
    >>> max_happiness(1000, 5, [(800, 2), (400, 5), (300, 5), (400, 3), (200, 2)])
    3900
    
    >>> max_happiness(50, 3, [(10, 1), (20, 2), (30, 3)])
